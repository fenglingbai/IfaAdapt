# IfaAdapt
The official deployment of the article "Anchoring Features via Freezing Weights: A Source-Relaxed Adaptation Approach for Subcellular Ultrastructure EM Segmentation"
<br />

This study presents IfaAdapt, a novel framework utilizing a feature anchor (FA) module for effective prior transfer from source to target domains.

<br />


We will make the code publicly available as soon as our article is published.
